## Data Descriptions:

- [2019 Novel Coronavirus Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) - Confirmed cases and 
deaths by country. Updated daily.
- [Population data](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) - Manually created csv file. Static.
- [CDC Flu View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cdcfluview/index.html) - Downloads of the most popular CDC data 
sources via the R package, cdcfluview. Updated daily.
- [Italy Flu Baseline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285#tbl0015) - Very rough estimates
of Itallian flu deaths over a four year period based on academic research models. Only max and min values for each flu
season are estimated.
- [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) - Data we all wish we had, but is too hard to find on our own. This 
group has made it a priority to track it down and consolidate it into one place. Hospitalizations, # in ICU, # on ventilators, # 
tests, and test results can be found in these data sets.
